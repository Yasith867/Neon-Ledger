Refactor the existing React + Vite frontend UI only.
DO NOT add any backend code, servers, API routes, or new logic.
Focus ONLY on improving the UI/UX and layout.

Context:
This is a frontend-only Web3 app that logs Solidity contract events and displays them in a real-time activity feed. The app uses Neon (serverless Postgres) and Polygon, but for this task you should NOT touch database logic or blockchain logic.

UI Goal:
Create a clean, modern dark Web3 dashboard UI suitable for a real-time onchain activity board (not a trading app).

Design Requirements:
- Dark theme with neon/purple/cyan accents
- Professional Web3 / infra-style look (Polygon + Neon vibe)
- No charts, no fake analytics, no placeholder metrics
- Simple, readable, and judge-friendly

Color Theme:
- Background: #0B0F14
- Cards: #121826
- Borders: #1F2937
- Primary accent: #8B5CF6 (purple)
- Secondary accent: #22D3EE (cyan)
- Main text: light gray / white
- Secondary text: muted gray

Layout Structure:
1. Top navigation bar
   - App name: “Neon Ledger”
   - Subtitle: “Real-Time Onchain Activity”
   - Connect Wallet button on the right

2. Main content (centered, max-width layout)
   - Card: “Log Onchain Action”
     - Text input
     - Primary button labeled “Send Transaction”
   - Card: “Live Onchain Activity”
     - Scrollable list of events
     - Each row shows:
       - Shortened wallet address
       - Action text
       - Timestamp (small, muted)
     - New events visually highlighted

3. Small footer or info card
   - Brief technical note: “Frontend-only. Solidity events indexed to Neon.”

Styling:
- Use Tailwind CSS
- Rounded corners (rounded-xl)
- Subtle shadows
- Soft hover effects on buttons
- No excessive animations

Rules:
- Do NOT change existing functionality
- Do NOT add or remove logic
- Do NOT add backend code
- Only refactor JSX structure and Tailwind classes
- Keep everything frontend-only

Deliverable:
- Updated JSX with clean layout
- Tailwind classes applied consistently
- UI should look production-ready and minimal
